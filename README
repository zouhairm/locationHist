This project is intended to keep track of days spent inside/outside of U.S. for immigration purposes.
It relies on location history gathered by Google location services.

# Note
======
Note that this includes files from http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.zip
and "countries" from https://github.com/che0/countries.git at commit 74a450c248674a74492bac31caf868f283401494 which unfortunately no longer exists so can't be pulled as a submodule (countries.patch is what was used to patch the repo)
